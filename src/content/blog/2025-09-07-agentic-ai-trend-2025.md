Globally, the tech industry is buzzing with a new phrase: Agentic AI. Unlike traditional AI models that only respond to prompts, Agentic AI can act independently, plan goals, and adapt without step-by-step human guidance.

## Why It’s Trending

According to Gartner’s 2025 Tech Trends, by 2028, one-third of AI interactions will involve agentic systems. Think of AI not as a chatbot, but as a digital coworker capable of handling tasks from start to finish.

## Applications Already Emerging

- **Customer Service** → AI that resolves complaints without escalation.
- **Logistics** → Systems that reroute deliveries in real time.
- **Finance** → Automated trading agents making split-second decisions.

## Risks & Challenges

- Ethical concerns about machines making decisions without oversight.
- **Bias and transparency** → Who is accountable when AI makes a mistake?
- **Security threats** → Agentic AI could be exploited for cyberattacks.

## Uganda’s Opportunity

Ugandan startups in fintech, agri-tech, and health could explore agentic AI assistants tailored to local needs—like crop monitoring bots or microfinance loan advisors.

👉 Agentic AI isn’t just the next big thing—it’s the next leap in how we interact with technology.
