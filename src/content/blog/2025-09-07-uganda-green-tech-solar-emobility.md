Uganda is quietly becoming a green tech hub in East Africa, with big moves in solar power and electric mobility (e-mobility).

## Solar Power Projects

The Ituka Solar Power Station, a 24 MW project in Arua District, is set to go live in 2025. This project is critical for:

- Reducing Uganda’s dependence on hydro dams
- Bringing clean power to rural communities
- Creating jobs in installation and maintenance

## Rise of E-Mobility

At the 2024 E-Mobility Expo Kampala, Kiira Motors Corporation showcased its electric buses and plans for local manufacturing. Uganda is not just importing EVs—it’s building them locally.

## Why This is Huge

- **Cleaner air** → Less pollution in Kampala.
- **Energy security** → Using Uganda’s solar potential for transport.
- **Industrial growth** → Boost for local manufacturing.

## Challenges Ahead

E-mobility needs charging stations, battery recycling, and government incentives. But the momentum is real, and Uganda could leapfrog into a green transport future.

👉 If Uganda continues this path, Kampala’s boda bodas may one day all be electric scooters, powered by the sun.
