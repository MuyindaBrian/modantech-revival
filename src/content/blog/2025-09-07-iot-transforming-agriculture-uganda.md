Uganda’s backbone is agriculture—employing over 70% of the population. But with climate change, unpredictable rainfall, and resource scarcity, smallholder farmers face constant challenges. Enter IoT (Internet of Things), a game-changing technology making its way into Uganda’s farms.

## What is IoT in Farming?

IoT uses low-cost sensors and devices to collect and analyze real-time data. For farmers, this means:

- Monitoring soil moisture
- Tracking weather conditions
- Automating irrigation systems
- Managing crop health remotely

## Uganda’s IoT Push in Agriculture

In Central Uganda, researchers are piloting smart maize farming systems powered by affordable sensors. These devices alert farmers when soil is too dry or when crops need nutrients, making water use more efficient and boosting yields.

## Why It Matters

- **Higher productivity** → More food security.
- **Cost savings** → Reduced water and fertilizer wastage.
- **Climate resilience** → Farmers adapt to unpredictable weather.

## The Road Ahead

For IoT to thrive in Uganda, investments in internet infrastructure, affordable devices, and training programs are essential. NGOs and startups have a golden opportunity to bridge this gap.

👉 Imagine a future where every Ugandan farmer checks crop health from a simple app on their phone. That’s the promise of IoT.
